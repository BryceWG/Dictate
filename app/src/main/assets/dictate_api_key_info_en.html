The last step is to <b>create an API key ðŸ”‘</b>. Dictate uses OpenAI Whisper in the background to convert the speech into text.<br>Each request costs a tiny fee ðŸ’° (about $0.36 per one hour of audio). To do this, you need to add a credit card to your OpenAI account and copy the API key you created into the app. It's very simple:
</p>
<p>
 1. <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview">Open the  billing page of OpenAI</a>, log in and add your credit card ðŸ’³ via the 'Add payment details' button.
</p>
<p>
 2. You need to purchase credits to your account in advance. These will then be used for transcription when you use Dictate.<br>To do this, click on the 'Add to credit balance' button. The minimum amount of $5 should be sufficient.
</p>
<p>
 3. Now that you can use the API, all you have to do is generate the API key ðŸ”‘ and copy it into the field below.<br>To do this, <a href="https://platform.openai.com/api-keys">go to the API-keys page</a> and click on the 'Create new secret key' button. You can enter a name, e.g. 'Dictate Key' and then click on the green button. After a short time, you will see a long text of random letters and numbers (it starts with 'sk-...'). Now click on 'Copy'.<br>Then go back to the Dictate app.
</p>
<p>
 4. Below this instruction you will find a text field. Hold it down and the 'Paste' button will appear. Click on it and the API key will be stored in Dictate.
</p>
<p>
 5. Now click on the 'Set API key and finish setup' button. You are now finished with the setup and can use Dictate. ðŸ¥³
